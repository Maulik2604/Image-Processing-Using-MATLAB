# Image-Processing-Using-MATLAB/n
This project creates an app using MATLAB which is used to perform various operations on an image./n
Operations are broadly classified into :-/n

1. Basic Operations/n
   These are some basic operations that are performed on an image. These are as follows:-/n
   (a) Upload Image/n
       Uploads image from your disk./n
   (b) RGB To Gray/n
       Converts a RGB image to grayscale./n
   (c) Convert To Binary Image/n
       Converts an image to binary./n


2. Advance Operations/n
   Some advance operations are performed under this category. These are as follows:-/n
   (a) Histogram/n
       Output a histogram of the image./n
   (b) Complement Image/n
       Outputa a complement of the image./n
   (c) Edge Detection/n
       Detect edges in the image uploaded./n
   (d) Rotate Clockwise/n
       This function rotates the image clockwise./n
   (e) Rotate Anti-Clockwise/n
       This function rotates the image anti-clockwise/n
