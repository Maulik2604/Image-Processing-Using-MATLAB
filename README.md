# Image-Processing-Using-MATLAB

This project creates an app using MATLAB which is used to perform various operations on an image.

Operations are broadly classified into :-


1. Basic Operations

   These are some basic operations that are performed on an image. These are as follows:-

   (a) Upload Image

       Uploads image from your disk.

   (b) RGB To Gray

       Converts a RGB image to grayscale.

   (c) Convert To Binary Image

       Converts an image to binary.


2. Advance Operations

   Some advance operations are performed under this category. These are as follows:-

   (a) Histogram

       Output a histogram of the image.

   (b) Complement Image

       Outputa a complement of the image.

   (c) Edge Detection

       Detect edges in the image uploaded.

   (d) Rotate Clockwise

       This function rotates the image clockwise.

   (e) Rotate Anti-Clockwise

       This function rotates the image anti-clockwise
